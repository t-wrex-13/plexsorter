# plexsorter
This is a personal project repo that looks to make plex server management just a little bit easier. It uses the PLEX API to make a connection to your PLEX server, which allows you to view metrics and see what content you have. Future updates will include the ability to manage your content from the app, but for now, this is more of a data dashboard than anything.
